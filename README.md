# Papers Scrap

This project is a web scraper designed to extract research paper details from Google Scholar. It automates the process of retrieving key information about academic papers, including:  

- **Title** – The name of the research paper  
- **Authors** – The list of authors who contributed to the paper  
- **Year** – The publication year  
- **Description** – A brief summary or snippet of the paper  
- **URL** – The link to the paper or its Google Scholar entry  
- **Citations** – The number of times the paper has been cited  

The scraper enables researchers and developers to collect relevant academic resources efficiently. It can be useful for literature reviews, data analysis, or academic research tracking.
